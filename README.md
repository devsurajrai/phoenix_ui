## About

This Component library is built with plain **HTML and CSS** to make the projects building process easy and fun. Also for the sake of consistancy in the projects which would be built using this Library. This component library is in its initial stages and would surely evolve on the way. I've built this for the personal use but if people can benifit from it would be my pleasure. 

### Installation
Just the link from below and paste in the header section of your html file as illustrated below
```
             <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/main.css">   
```

**In addition to including the whole component library in your project, Phoenix UI also gives you an option to import only the component you need. Suppose you need to use the CARDS components only, You can do that by only adding the stylesheet CDN only for the CARDS component.**

**EXAMPLE**
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/components/card/card.css">
```
** The CDN link for each component is mentioned in the documentation.**

### Using the same icons as in the components

The icons/images used in this component library are stored locally in the project. So, in order for you to be able to use that just make a small change in the image source url as stated below:<br>
Imagine you are using E-Commerce Nav Component, then to use the svg icons used in that nav bar just do the following:
```
<img src="../../Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg" alt="search">

The default source of the image is "../../Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg"
Simply change the source to "https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg"

<img src="https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg" alt="search">

```
### Running the Component Library Locally

1. Clone the repository by running the command in your terminal.

```
git clone git@github.com:devsurajrai/phoenix_ui.git

```
2. A directory named "phonenix_ui" will be created on your machine.
3. Go to the index.html and use the live server to run the project.

### Contributing to the project

2. Refer the **style-guide.css** and **utilities.css** to get the idea what pattern is followed.
3. Create a new branch as your component name from **development** branch.
4. Create the component.
5. Commit the Changes.
6. Push the changes and open a pull request.
7. Pull request will be reviewed by the maintainer and merged if found okay.
