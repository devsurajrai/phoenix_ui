**In addition to including the whole component library in your project, Phoenix UI also gives you an option to import only the component you need. Suppose you need to use the CARDS components only, You can do that by only adding the stylesheet CDN for the CARDS component Only.**

**EXAMPLE**
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/components/card/card.css">
```

### Using the same icons as in the components

The icons/images used in this component library are stored locally in the project. So, in order for you to be able to use that just make a small change in the image source url as stated below:
Imagine you are using E-Commerce Nav Component, then to use the svg icons used in that nav bar just do the following:
```
<img src="../../Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg" alt="search">

The default source of the image is "../../Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg"
Simply change the source to "https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg"

<img src="https://ui-phoenix.netlify.app/Assets/svg/navigation/search.svg" alt="search">

```
### Running the Component Library Locally

1. Clone the repository by running the command in your terminal.

```
git clone git@github.com:devsurajrai/phoenix_ui.git

```
2. A directory named "phonenix_ui" will be created on your machine.
3. Go to the index.html and use the live server to run the project.

### Adding new components to PHOENIX UI

1. Do the steps (1-2) exactly as above.
2. Refer the **style-guide.css** and **utilities.css** to get the idea what pattern is followed.
3. Create a new branch as your component name from **development** branch.
4. Create the component.
5. Commit the Changes.
6. Push the changes and open a pull request.
